                        This is the "Pomodoro Technique" and this is a time management method developed by 
                        Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        This method use a timer set to 25 minutes separeted by short 
                        breaks of 5 minutes and after 100 minutes you can take a break of 15 or 30 minutes. 
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Simple right? The answer is YES, but when the timer is on, you can't use your phone to do other 
                        tasks that makes you to distract, so get in work and have fun!
